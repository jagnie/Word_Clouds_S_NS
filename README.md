Project Description: Creating a Word Cloud for Stemming and Non-Stemming Words
Project Goal:
The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the differences between stemming and non-stemming by creating word clouds based on text data.

Concept:
Data Collection:

Select an appropriate dataset containing text with both stemmed and non-stemmed variations.
Data Processing:

Normalize the text by removing punctuation, digits, and other unnecessary elements.
Tokenize the text, breaking it into individual words, and convert all words to lowercase.
Stemming:

Apply a stemming algorithm, such as using the NLTK library, to reduce words to their base forms.
Word Cloud Creation:

Generate word clouds for both stemmed and non-stemmed text using the WordCloud library in Python. Use different colors, sizes, and layouts to visualize the frequency of individual words.
Non-Stemming:

Compare the results by repeating the process for text without stemming.
Comparing Results:

Contrast the word clouds for stemming and non-stemming, identifying differences in the most frequently occurring words.
Technologies:
Python (programming language)
NLTK library for stemming
WordCloud library for creating word clouds
Additional visualization libraries for enhanced presentation
